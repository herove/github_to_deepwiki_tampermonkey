Adds a button to GitHub repo pages to open the corresponding DeepWiki page.

## Installation

1.  Make sure you have a userscript manager installed, such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/).
2.  Click on the link to the `github-to-deepwiki.user.js` file in this repository (or find the raw file link).
3.  Your userscript manager should prompt you to install the script. Confirm the installation.

Alternatively, you can manually create a new script in your userscript manager and paste the content of `github-to-deepwiki.user.js` into it.

4.  Or, install directly from Greasy Fork:

## Usage

Once installed, navigate to any GitHub repository's main page (e.g., `https://github.com/user/repo`). A new button "ðŸš€ Open in DeepWiki" will appear near the other action buttons (like Watch, Fork, Star). Clicking this button will open a new tab directed to the corresponding DeepWiki page (`https://deepwiki.com/user/repo`).
